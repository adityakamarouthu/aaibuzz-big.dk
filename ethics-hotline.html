  <h1>BJARKE INGELS GROUP ETHICS HOTLINE</h1>
  <p>
    BIG is committed to lawful and ethical behavior in all our activities and
    requires employees, executives and partners to act in accordance with
    applicable laws, regulations and policies and to observe high standards of
    business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and
    responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The BIG Ethics Hotline applies to all employees, executives and partners of
    BIG as well as applicants and former employees of BIG or any other person
    that in any event can relate to BIG. Such persons are strongly encouraged to
    share their concerns about a violation or potential violation in accordance
    with the BIG Ethics Hotline under which the reporting persons will receive
    protection.
  </p>
  <h2>1. REPORTING</h2>
  <h3>Who can report?</h3>
  <p>
    The BIG Ethics Hotline applies to all employees, executives and partners of
    BIG as well as applicants and former employees of BIG or any other person
    that in any event can relate to BIG.
  </p>
  <h3>What can be reported?</h3>
  <p>
    The BIG Ethics Hotline applies to reports of any actual or potential
    violation that:
  </p>
  <p>
    (i) Relates to EU, Spanish and Danish law (e.g., fraud, money laundering or
    public procurement offences, environmental protection, public health and
    consumer and data protection), as well as
  </p>
  <p>
    (ii) Reports of serious offenses or other serious matters such as sexual
    harassment, duty of confidentiality, misuse of financial means
    (embezzlement, bribery, fraud, theft etc.), serious harassment due to race,
    political or religious affiliation etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    If in doubt whether to report an observation or experience, we strongly
    encourage you to do so.<br />All reports will be processed and responded to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reports on a person’s own employment, personnel conflicts, or personal
    matters as well as violations of internal guidelines and rules will in
    principle fall outside the scope of BIG Ethics Hotline. Except in case of
    serious and repeated breach, reports and information regarding these
    matters, shall be reported to the People Team, your superior or the Managing
    Director by direct email (non-anonymous) or by using BIG People Hotline
    formular on BIG.net (anonymous).
  </p>
  <h3>How to report?</h3>
  <p>
    Reporting persons can submit a report by using the online formular found
    below (anonymous) or by writing to the following email: <a href="https://big.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6c091804050f1f040318000502092c0e050b420807">[email&#160;protected]</a>
    (non-anonymous).
  </p>
  <h2>2. PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
  <h3>Acting in good faith</h3>
  <p>
    All reporting persons receive immediate protection under BIG Ethics Hotline,
    provided they had reasonable grounds to believe that the reported
    information was true at the time of reporting and that such information fell
    within the scope of BIG Ethics Hotline. This means that all reporting
    persons must be acting in good faith. Any allegations that prove not to be
    substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to
    be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense. Furthermore, the
    reporting persons will not be protected under BIG Ethics Hotline.
  </p>
  <h3>No liability or retaliation</h3>
  <p>
    People who report do not incur any liability for having breached an
    obligation of professional secrecy, provided they had reasonable grounds to
    believe that the reported information was necessary to reveal an actual or
    potential violation.
  </p>
  <p>
    No reporting person who makes a good faith report under BIG Ethics Hotline
    or any third party who cooperates in inquiries or investigations shall
    suffer harassment, retaliation, or adverse employment consequence. Any
    reporting person who believes that he or she has been subjected to any form
    of retaliation because of making a good faith report under BIG Ethics
    Hotline should immediately report the retaliation to the CEO or the Chairman
    of the Board of Directors by email.
  </p>
  <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>
    BIG Ethics Hotline is operated in a secure manner that ensures that
    confidentiality of (i) the identity of the reporting person, (ii) the
    identity of a person who is referred to in the report as a person to whom
    the violation is attributed and (iii) any third party mentioned in the
    report is protected and (iv) prevents access thereto by non-authorized staff
    members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reports under the BIG Ethics Hotline will be kept confidential to the extent
    possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.
    Furthermore, if a report results in a lawsuit being initiated against the
    reported person, the reporting person risks being called as a witness in the
    trial.
  </p>
  <h2>3. WHAT HAPPENS ONCE A REPORT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED?</h2>
  <p>
    The Ethics Responsible Team will upon receipt of a reporting notify the
    reporting person and acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or
    suspected violation within seven calendar days.
  </p>
  <p>
    All reports will be promptly investigated in an independent manner intended
    to establish trust and protect confidentiality, consistent with a full and
    fair investigation. Appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted
    by the investigation. Where necessary, the reporting person may be asked for
    further information, albeit without there being an obligation to provide
    such information.
  </p>
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    Reporting persons will receive information on the action envisaged or taken
    as a follow-up on the reporting and the grounds for the choice of follow-up
    (“feedback”). Follow-up can include, for instance, referral to other
    channels, launch of an internal enquiry, any measures taken to address the
    issue raised, or closure of the procedure based on lack of sufficient
    evidence or other grounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    The feedback will be provided within three months from the acknowledgment of
    receipt was sent to the reporting person. Where the appropriate follow-up is
    still being determined, the reporting person will be informed about this and
    about any further feedback to expect.
  </p>
  <h3>Internal registration at BIG</h3>
  <p>
    A summary of the report, follow-up and feedback will be registered for
    record and to be presented to the Managing Director, local partner group and
    the CEO on a regular basis.
  </p>
  <h2>4. EXTERNAL OPTIONS</h2>
  <p>
    BIG strongly encourage anyone who wishes to raise a concern to do so through
    BIG Ethics Hotline prior to seeking resolution outside BIG.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it is also possible to report externally to The Danish Data
    Protection Agency through The National Whistleblower Scheme
    (https://whistleblower.dk/english) or to The Spanish Autoridad Independiente
    de Protección del Informante (the “AAI”).
